### Drone
[3DR Solo](https://3dr.com/solo-drone/specs/) w/Gimbal and GoPro HERO4 camera 

The [Solo architecture](https://dev.3dr.com/concept-architecture.html) shows the primary companion computer (iMX.6) that runs Yocto Linux. The [accessory port](https://dev.3dr.com/hardware-accessorybay.html) provides USB access to the iMX.6 via a breakout board, but the kernel only includes support for USB serial devices (FTDI and CDC-ACM). Adding a secondary companion computer provides some additional flexibility, and reduces the chances of bricking the primary.

### Secondary Companion Computer

[Odroid C0](http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G145326484280) with battery

One really nice aspect of the C0 is the integrated battery power circuit. The Solo accessory port can provide 5V power, but it's limited to 1.05A.

### LTE dongle

Aircard 340u (AT&T Beam)

Some good background on [LTE in Linux](https://aleksander.es/data/FOSDEM%202014%20-%20LTE%20in%20your%20Linux%20based%20system.pdf).

The Aircard 340u is not correctly recognized in Linux until a [firmware patch](http://www.downloads.netgear.com/files/aircard/AC340U_linux_patch_v4.zip) is applied. The patch disables the Windows 8 MBIM Identity Morphing.

Note that the dongle is not always recognized on boot. However, it does show up after re-inserting it.

### Cloud Control Station (CCS)

[MAVProxy](http://qgroundcontrol.org/mavlink/mavproxy_startpage) running on an Ubuntu 16.04 droplet on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

The CCS will be the final endpoint for the [MAVLink](http://qgroundcontrol.org/mavlink/start) telemetry messaging. Ideally, ICE/STUN/TURN (Voice-over-IP folks will recognize these !) would allow a Ground Control Station (GCS) on a laptop (also behind a NAT) to communicate with the LTE-connected drone.

### Telemetry Forwarding (Secondary Companion Computer)

[MAVProxy](http://qgroundcontrol.org/mavlink/mavproxy_startpage) also supports forwarding of [MAVLink](http://qgroundcontrol.org/mavlink/start) telemetry.

### Drone/Companion Computer USB Connection

A [breakout board](http://viresity.com/product/3dr-solo-accessory-breakout-board/) provides a micro USB OTG interface to Solo via the [accessory port](https://dev.3dr.com/hardware-accessorybay.html).

Connecting the Odroid C0 to Solo via a USB OTG cable creates a serial device (/dev/ttyACM0) on the Odroid C0, and a serial device (/dev/ttyGS0) on the Solo. By default, Solo supports login via the /dev/ttyGS0 device. This must be disabled via /etc/inittab.

### Next Steps

* Convert Solo to WiFi AP, and use WiFi between Odroid and Solo.
* Characterize LTE communication during flight
* Stream video over LTE
* Investigate ICE/STUN/TURN options for MAVLink messaging via NATs
